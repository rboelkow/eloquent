/*  EX 1
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.
let abc = "abc"; console.log(abc.length); // → 3
*/
for (var i = 0, output = "#"; i < 7; console.log(output), i++, output += "#");
// book recommends to use .len property, iterating over the length of the output would change the code to be like
for (var i = 0, output = "#"; output.length < 7; console.log(output), i++, output += "#");

/* EX 2
FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)

/* EX 3A
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
#### ####

#### ####
